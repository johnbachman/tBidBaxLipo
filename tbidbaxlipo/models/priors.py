"""
Implementation of prior distributions for MCMC fitting.

These classes provide the ability to calculate the probability of given values
according the appropriate PDF, and also allow for sampling of random numbers
from these distributions (which is useful for choosing randomized initial
values for an MCMC walk, for example).

I chose to write these simple classes rather than use the distributions in
scipy.stats because according to a few empirical tests using the %time command
in ipython, I found that making calculations from a uniform PDF (which would be
required at every MCMC iteration) was approximately two orders of magnitude
faster using this approach rather than the classes in scipy.stats.
