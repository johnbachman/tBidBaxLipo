Motivation: to understand mechanistic basis of Bax pore formation kinetics.

1. Experimental system, data, phenomenological model

- One and two exponential equations (history of this equation from Schwarz, Schlesinger, Newmeyer)

- Two-phase scaling of the kinetic constant, k

- Hyperbolic scaling of the Fmax

- *** Identifiability of the parameters?***

2. Screening of model ensemble against in vitro kinetic data.

- Fit to primary data, not reduced (feature-based) data.

- All models fit poorly, no mechanistic additions increase fit

- Hypothesis from shape of kinetic curve: saturable Bax-liposome association complex

- Adding this feature allows all models to fit regardless of protein interaction topology

3. Experimental evidence for saturable association complex

- Localization kinetics, measured by NBD-fluorescence or by membrane FRET, slow down at higher Bax (***but approach same steady state level?***)

- Measuring the association complex by FRET: fraction of Bax bound saturates at high Bax/liposome ratios

- Measure by FCS

- Measure by BLI (Fortebio)

- ***To be reconciled***:
	- gel filtration shows saturation of equilibrium binding at high Bax/lipo ratios
	- NBD fluorescence appears to show that same steady state level is approached

4. Mechanistic basis for saturability

- ***Repeat above experiments in presence/absence of cardiolipin (negatively charged lipids)***


5. Accounting for non-independent binding across liposomes

- It is generally believed that Bax binding is cooperative

- Cooperatvity implies non-independent binding to liposomes

- Multi-compartment model shows that non-independent binding would change bulk kinetics from what is observed

- Suggests that cooperativity/Bax aggregation may play a less dominant kinetic role

- ***Does K21E mutation inhibit membrane binding or only oligomerization?***

- Need for single vesicle approaches to measure Bax/liposome distribution.
