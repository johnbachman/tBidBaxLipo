"Compartmentalization of reactions at membranes plays a critical role in the
rate and extent of apoptotic pore formation by Bax"

B + L <> BL >> BL*

What I am trying to explain:

    - non-origin nature of slope of Bax permeabilization?

    - Show that reaction topology determines whether the continuum model
      matches the compartment model.

Need to show experimentally true as well as theoretically true

Coins/buckets argument

    - hinges in part on the fact that the curve is a two-parameter curve, with
      both k and fmax.

    - Both enzyme and pore formation case don't provide explanations for why
      fmax is less than 100%.

**Evaluation of permeabilization models for individual perm. curves**

    - This could potentially go in the liposome perm kinetics chapter.

Figure: Example permeabilization curve.

Table listing models, with references and features

    - Exponential model (1 and 2 and 3 sum exponentials)

    - Schwarz: log transform the data to estimate "number of pores"

    - One and two exponential equations (history of this equation from Almeida,
      Schwarz, Schlesinger

    - Kushnareva/Newmeyer model: enzymatic style

    - European group paper?

Bax specific:

    - Phenomenology: a delay; nearly exponential activity; maximal activity
      below 100% permeabilization; slow rise;

    - At start, you have no pores nucleated, auto-activation helps
      get pores nucleated, hence the acceleration. However, this
      starts to fight against the depletion of Bax due to recruitment
      to existing pores, and eventually depletion wins out.

    - Three velocities: initial, intermediate, final; pore production is
      linear at each one? dp/dt = k

    - Two-phase scaling of the kinetic constant, k

    - Hyperbolic scaling of the Fmax

**Prediction of role of auto-activation**

    - Auto-activation may deplete 

**Refute notion that linearity in slope indicates non-saturation and
non-cooperativity!**

    - Show timescale separation analysis??
