Simulation
==========

1C and MC models were specified programmatically using PySB (ref). 1C models
were converted from a rule-based representation into ODEs via BioNetGen and
and integrated numerically using VODE (ref). MC models were simulated using
BioNetGen's included stochastic simulation algorithm (ref).
