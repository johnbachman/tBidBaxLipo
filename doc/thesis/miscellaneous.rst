* Methods of modeling liposome permeabilization kinetics
    - Review of previously described methods
    - Comparison of compartmentalized vs. continuous representations of
      liposomes

* Molecular mechanism of Bax membrane insertion during activation and pore
   formation
    - What is the conformational pathway of Bax as it inserts into the
      membrane?  Does it depend on the mechanism of activation?
    - Identifying the number of conformational intermediates by model comparison
    - Bax inserts into membranes before pore formation
    - Dynamics of Bid-Bax rearrangements during activation

* Kinetics of liposome permeabilization by Bid and Bax
    - What determines kinetics of pore formation by Bax.  In particular, what
      are the relative roles of membrane binding, activation by BH3-only
      proteins, and auto-activation by Bax itself
    - Role of liposome binding sites for Bid but not for Bax
    - Saturability of Bid by Bax
    - Role of auto-activation at different activator strengths
    - Measurement of Bax distribution by single-molecule microscopy

* Stability and stoichiometry of the Bax pore
    - What is the nature of the pore? Lipidic vs. proteinaceous, stable vs.
      transient, fixed vs. variable.
    - Determinants of all-or-none vs. graded release
    - Minimal stoichiometry of the pore, inference from bulk measurements
    - Minimal stoichiometry of the pore, single-molecule measurements

Stability and stoichiometry of the pore
---------------------------------------

  - **All-or-none pore formation and stable insertion by Bax is dependent on
    the presence of activator.**

    - *Activation of Bax by heat does not produce substantial amounts of
      inserted Bax.*

    - *Activation of Bax by heat leads to graded release(?)* Tried this
      experiment before, need to repeat due to complete failure.

    - *Activation of Bax by heat leads to*

  - **Stoichiometry of the pore**

    - *Can it be estimated from the amount of permeabilization achieved
      at low Bax/lipo ratios* (when auto-activation would be presumed to be
      minimal?). Idea would be to operate in a regime where the probability of
      being inserted would be high, and relatively independent of the amount of
      Bax already on the liposome (e.g., a high BH3 or Bid situation). In
      this regime the effect of the exponential nature of permeabilization
      would also have a minimal effect, because the probability of getting
      "more than one pore" per liposome would be small.

Motivation: to understand mechanistic basis of Bax pore formation kinetics.

- *** Identifiability of the parameters?***

2. Screening of model ensemble against in vitro kinetic data.

- Fit to primary data, not reduced (feature-based) data.

- All models fit poorly, no mechanistic additions increase fit

- Hypothesis from shape of kinetic curve: saturable Bax-liposome association
  complex

- Adding this feature allows all models to fit regardless of protein
  interaction topology

3. Experimental evidence for saturable association complex

- Localization kinetics, measured by NBD-fluorescence or by membrane FRET, slow
  down at higher Bax (***but approach same steady state level?***)

- Measuring the association complex by FRET: fraction of Bax bound saturates at
  high Bax/liposome ratios

- Measure by FCS

- ***To be reconciled***:
    - gel filtration shows saturation of equilibrium binding at high Bax/lipo
      ratios
    - NBD fluorescence appears to show that same steady state level is
      approached

4. Mechanistic basis for saturability

- ***Repeat above experiments in presence/absence of cardiolipin (negatively charged lipids)***


5. Accounting for non-independent binding across liposomes

- It is generally believed that Bax binding is cooperative

- Cooperatvity implies non-independent binding to liposomes

- Multi-compartment model shows that non-independent binding would change bulk kinetics from what is observed

- Suggests that cooperativity/Bax aggregation may play a less dominant kinetic
  role

- ***Does K21E mutation inhibit membrane binding or only oligomerization?***

- Need for single vesicle approaches to measure Bax/liposome distribution.
