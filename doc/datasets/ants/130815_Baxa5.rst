Bax :math:`\alpha 5` peptide, pilot experiment (8/15/13)
========================================================

A pilot experiment to explore kinetics of liposome permeabilization by the
Bax-:math:`\alpha 5` peptide. At first I tried a by-plate measuring strategy
but the kinetics were far too fast for this. With the small amont of liposomes
I had left (after wasting most of it in the dispenser pump), I measured 4
wells: two with approximately 4 uM peptide (20 uM starting solution, diluted
1:5, 20 uL of peptide solution in 100 uL total reaction volume), and 1:10
dilution of liposomes (50 uL of 1:5 diluted liposomes in 100 uL total volume),
approximately 5 nM.
