NBD-Bax Kinetics
================

Fluorescence kinetics of NBD-labeled single-cysteine mutants of Bax. Different
Single-cysteine mutations at different positions allow the kinetics of membrane
insertion or conformational change to be measured; titration experiments show
the effects of different protein or liposome concentrations on the kinetics.
