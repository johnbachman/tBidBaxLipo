NBD-Bax Kinetics
================

Fluorescence kinetics of NBD-labeled single-cysteine mutants of Bax. NBD is a
dye that fluoresces more strongly in a hydrophobic than a polar environment.
Conjugation of NBD to a variety of single-cysteine Bax mutants allows the
kinetics of membrane insertion or conformational change to be measured at
different position. Titration experiments show the effects of different protein
or liposome concentrations on the insertion kinetics.
