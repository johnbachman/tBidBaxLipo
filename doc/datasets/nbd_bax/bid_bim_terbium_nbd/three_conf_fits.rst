Fits to three-conformation model
================================

In the bar plots of the fitted k1/k2 values, the error bars are the
standard deviations of the best fit values determined from the fit,
while the three bars are fits for replicates 1, 2, and 3. The red
bars are for k1, the green bars are for k2.
