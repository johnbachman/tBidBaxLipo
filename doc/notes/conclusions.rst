Summary/Conclusions
===================

**Biphasic character of dye release/pore curves.**
    This was most visible in the :doc:`first round of dye release curves
    </datasets/ants/tbid_bax_lipo_1>`. However this effect, though still
    visible, was much reduced in the :doc:`second round of curves
    </datasets/ants/tbid_bax_lipo_2>`. Hypotheses considered included tBid-Bax
    inhibition or Bax depletion and subsequent recycling through dissociation.
    Another explanations to consider could be tBid dissociation (jumping).

**Biphasic character of NBD-Bax insertion curves (by PTI).**
    This was most visible in the curves that Justin measured in the PTI,
    especially the c62 mutant. A possible explanation for the c62 signal
    was tBid-Bax inhibition coupled with a fluorescence change that depends
    on a protein-protein interface between tBid and Bax (and/or between
    Bax and Bax).

**Multi-phasic NBD-Bax curves.**
    Justin's :doc:`data for 15 NBD-Bax mutants </datasets/nbd_bax/plate_1>`
    measured in the plate reader suggest that there are 3-4 intermediate
    states, with different residues fluorescing differently in these states.
    However, this remains to be analyzed further using data from the PTI.

**Effects of Bax-liposome titration on Bax insertion kinetics.**
    The results from Justin's :doc:`c126 titration experiment
    </datasets/nbd_bax/c126_titration>` show clearly that increasing liposome
    concentration makes Bax insertion faster, saturating at high
    concentrations.  This can be explained even with a simple solution/liposome
    :ref:`partitioning model <bax-insertion-partitioning-model>` due to the
    larger fraction of Bax peripherally bound to membranes and hence the more
    rapid production of inserted Bax. However, the simple partitioning model
    :ref:`fails to explain <bax-insertion-partitioning-model>` why increasing
    Bax concentration should :ref:`make the insertion kinetics slower
    <bax-liposome-surface>`. However, this can be addressed by :ref:`accounting
    for the saturation of the activator tBid <bax-insertion-tbid-activation>`.
    It is possible that a liposome binding site model in which Bax only
    occupies sites while it is peripherally bound and not after it is inserted,
    though this seems that it would be equivalent to the tBid case (where the
    amount of tBid is a stand-in for the "binding sites" of the liposome).

**tBid titration shows no inhibition at high tBid.**
    Need to add figures and data here.

**mDivi-1 and analogs inhibit dye release in liposomes.**
    Kushnareva et al.  showed that permeabilization of outer membrane vesicles
    (OMVs) derived from mitochondria was inhibited by the addition of analogs
    of the drug mDivi-1, whose canonical mechanism is the inhibition of the
    GTPase Drp1/Dnm1, which is responsible for mitochondrial fission
    [Kushnareva2012]_. Despite the lack of detectable Drp1 in their OMVs, and
    the lack of any GTP in the system, the authors concluded that this result
    supported their supposition of a "catalyst" protein responsible for
    permeabilization in OMVs. However, :ref:`experiments with synthetic
    liposomes <130830_mDivi1_analogs>` suggest that these drugs inhibit
    Bax-mediated permeabilization even in the absence of any putative catalyst
    protein. Moreover, the rank-ordering of the effect of these drugs in the
    synthetic liposome system is the same as in their OMV system, with analog H
    the most potent, then analog B, followed by the inactive analog 309s
    (actually, my experiments show that the canonical mDivi-1 is actually the
    most potent, but they did not show results for this drug in their paper).
    Interestingly, the drugs also show a base level of liposome permeabilizing
    activity, and the rank ordering of this activity is the same as their
    activity in suppressing Bax-mediated permeabilization, with analog H
    causing the most permeabilization, followed by analog B and 309s
    (interestingly, mDivi-1 itself causes the lowest basal permeabilization
    despite have the greatest effect on Bax). It is important to note, however,
    that the magnitude of the permeabilization inhibition is nearly 100% in the
    OMV system of Kushnareva et al, while only approximately 50% for mDivi-1 in
    the synthetic liposome system. One possible interpretation of these results
    is that, first, the effect of mDivi-1 on permeabilization in both OMVs and
    synthetic liposomes is based on an interaction with either lipids, Bax, or
    tBid, and not with a catalyst protein; second, that the mDivi-1 analogs
    interact with lipid membranes to destabilize them and cause slow release of
    small-molecule marker dyes. Taken together, this suggests that the effect
    of the mDivi-1 analogs is to alter lipid organization or packing in such a
    way as to restrict or retard the formation of Bax pores.

**Heated Bax shows dose-dependent increase in kinetics and max release.**
    Should transfer notes from lab notebook to here.

**Two-phase dependence of kinetic rate on Bax concentration for Bax 43C**
    Possibly due to oligomerization being the rate limiting step?

**Stochastic and deterministic models agree.**
    Do this.
