Observations and Conclusions
============================

**Biphasic character of dye release/pore curves.**
    This was most visible in the :doc:`first round of dye release curves
    </datasets/ants/tbid_bax_lipo_1>`. However this effect, though still
    visible, was much reduced in the :doc:`second round of curves
    </datasets/ants/tbid_bax_lipo_2>`. Hypotheses considered included tBid-Bax
    inhibition or Bax depletion and subsequent recycling through dissociation.
    Another explanations to consider could be tBid dissociation (jumping).

**Biphasic character of NBD-Bax insertion curves (by PTI).**
    This was most visible in the curves that Justin measured in the PTI,
    especially the c62 mutant. A possible explanation for the c62 signal
    was tBid-Bax inhibition coupled with a fluorescence change that depends
    on a protein-protein interface between tBid and Bax (and/or between
    Bax and Bax).

**Multi-phasic NBD-Bax curves.**
    Justin's :doc:`data for 15 NBD-Bax mutants </datasets/nbd_bax/plate_1>`
    measured in the plate reader suggest that there are 3-4 intermediate
    states, with different residues fluorescing differently in these states.
    However, this remains to be analyzed further using data from the PTI.

**Effects of Bax-liposome titration on Bax insertion kinetics.**
    The results from Justin's :doc:`c126 titration experiment
    </datasets/nbd_bax/c126_titration>` show clearly that increasing liposome
    concentration makes Bax insertion faster, saturating at high
    concentrations.  This can be explained even with a simple solution/liposome
    :ref:`partitioning model <bax-insertion-partitioning-model>` due to the
    larger fraction of Bax peripherally bound to membranes and hence the more
    rapid production of inserted Bax. However, the simple partitioning model
    :ref:`fails to explain <bax-insertion-partitioning-model>` why increasing
    Bax concentration should :ref:`make the insertion kinetics slower
    <bax-liposome-surface>`. However, this can be addressed by :ref:`accounting
    for the saturation of the activator tBid <bax-insertion-tbid-activation>`.
    It is possible that a liposome binding site model in which Bax only
    occupies sites while it is peripherally bound and not after it is inserted,
    though this seems that it would be equivalent to the tBid case (where the
    amount of tBid is a stand-in for the "binding sites" of the liposome).

**tBid titration shows no inhibition at high tBid.**
    Need to add figures and data here.

**Heated Bax shows dose-dependent increase in kinetics and max release.**
    Should transfer notes from lab notebook to here.

**Two-phase dependence of kinetic rate on Bax concentration for Bax 43C**
    Possibly due to oligomerization being the rate limiting step?

**Stochastic and deterministic models agree.**
    Do this.
