Notes on the Models
===================

C3
--

So far I've tried two models against the C3 data, both with the assumption that
the C3 signal is indicative of an activation step of Bax, but prior to
dimerization. 

TAD: Activation and Dimerization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This model converges reasonably well (though not perfectly) and cannot fit
the shape of the C3 curve.

TAI: Activation and Re-binding of tBid to Bax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This model can achieve fits with likelihood as low as 

C62
---

I've run the following: TA, TAR, TAD, TAI, and TARD, with the C62 signal
attributable to ``Bax(bh3=1)`` (that is, the BH3 domain of Bax bound to
either tBid or Bax). 

TAD, TARD appear able to fit the data fairly well; TAI also is able to fit the
data reasonably well. However, it remains to be seen how the fits will perform
if the signal is only from Bax dimers (not from tBid/Bax complexes).

TA
~~
Interestingly, but not unexpectedly, neither TA nor TAR
could produce good fits to the data. Since the only source of complexes
involving Bax in these models is the tBid/Bax complex formed en route to
activation, in a typical scenario tBid/Bax would go up and go down, much as
the ES complex would rise and then decline as substrate is converted to product.

The fits produced by this model, as might be expected, involve a slow
formation of the tBid/Bax complex, followed by much slower dissociation and
catalytic rates. In this model the slowly rising signal is assumed to be the
slow formation of the tBid/Bax complex.

TAR
~~~
This model doesn't do any better than TA, interestingly.
