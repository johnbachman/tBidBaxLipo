# tBidBaxLipo: Analysis of Bax Interactions from in vitro Measurements

## Make instructions for Kale NBD/FRET datasets

Run the following from `kale/make`:

* `make pt_data1`: Generate .fit files and run MCMC fitting for Kinetic
  Dataset 1 (NBD-Bax fluorescence with Bid and Bim as activators).

* `make pt_data2`: Generate .fit files and run MCMC fitting for Kinetic
  Dataset 2 (NBD-Bax fluorescence and FRET with DAC-Bid/DAC-Bim).
